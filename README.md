# Data-Breach-Detection
### This project focuses on the detection, classification, and trajectory prediction of space debris using Computer Vision (CV) and Time-Series (TS) Analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for debris detection and classification, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used to forecast debris movement. The system aims to enhance satellite safety and improve space traffic management through accurate tracking and predictive analysis.
